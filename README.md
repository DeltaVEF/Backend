# Backend

The proposal is to use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the brain of the application. There are a few reasons for this:

* Open source;
* Node Package Manager (NPM): thousands of pre-cut solutions can be found in NPM for common problems;
* Lightweight and Linux-compatible;
* Excellent seperations of concern.

To complete the development stack, a technology as `Express` can be used to create a clean solution for a REST API. Furthermore, `Socket.io` can be used for any real-time communication and for fast data-storage `MongoDB` in combination with `Mongoose.js` can be used.
